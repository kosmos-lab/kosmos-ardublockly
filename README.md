# Ardublockly
Ardublockly is a visual programming editor for Arduino. It is based on Google's [Blockly][1], which has been forked to generate [Arduino][15] code.

The `ArdublocklyServer` Python package initialises a local server to be able to compile and load the Arduino code using the [Arduino IDE][2].

This version of Kosmos-ardublockly has been extended with blocks (i.e. Arduino-Grove modules, Neopixel LEDs) as well as the German language and is being further developed for use as a tool for maker workshops with students.
